## Hi there 👋

<!--
**daniilvedishchev/daniilvedishchev** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I'm passionate about **finance**, **trading**, **mathematics**, and **programming**. On this profile, you'll find projects related to these interests, as well as some learning experiences and contributions that I’ve made.

## 🚗 Self Driving Car Project

One of my recent projects involves an **autonomous car** that detects the road. This project uses image processing and artificial intelligence techniques to allow the car to safely navigate the road. The key components of this project include lane detection, obstacle anticipation, and path optimization.

### Technologies used:
- **Python** (for image processing and AI)
- **OpenCV** (for road and object detection)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for machine learning)
- **Raspberry Pi** or **Arduino** (for hardware interface)
- **Simulations and Virtual Environments** (to test algorithms before real-world implementation)

## 💻 Skills & Interests

I have a deep interest in **mathematics** applied to **finance**, **algorithmic trading**, and **programming**. I enjoy developing innovative solutions, exploring new tools, and deepening my knowledge in complex subjects.

- **Quantitative Finance**: Financial data analysis, stochastic modeling, risk management.
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Creating strategies based on mathematical and statistical models.
- **Applied Mathematics**: Linear algebra, optimization, numerical methods, statistics.
- **Programming**: Python, C++, JavaScript, building tools and applications.

### Skills:
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn (sklearn)
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
